This script looks at identifying the following: 
Interaction A: Did users who received money from ShapeShift perform a coinjoin right after?
Interaction B: Were coins sent to ShapeShift obtained from a coinjoin?

Our rules for whether a transaction is a coinjoin are:
    - more than 2 inputs
    - more than 2 outputs
    - all outputs have the same value
    - the output value belongs to the set of possible denominations 
        (denominations are fixed in Dash)
    
Interaction A is done by looking at whether users who received money from a Phase 2 transaction,
where Dash is the curOut, peformed a coinjoin right after. This function uses the results 
from phase 2, checks the transaction labelled as the Dash transaction, checks if it has been 
spent, and if so, whether the spent transactions output follows the rules for a coinjoin. 

Interaction B is found by looking for transactions that had been obtained from a coinjoin. 
This looks at Phase 1 transactions, where Dash is a curIn, and if the transaction inputs  
were originally from the output of a coinjoin. Thus this will cycle through all inputs, 
finding if their spent transaction was a type of coinjoin.
